# Actor Critic with Summarization

Please note, we have further commits that is after the deadline.

This has to be done, because our code is based on another course's assignment, and it contains answers to that. We have to remove them.

Thank you for your understanding


# To run experiments

We use python 3.9, but anything above that should work except 3.12, which is not supported by metadrive

We have provided ACSummarizeProject.ipynb that contains all code to run and generate graphs for the experiments.
